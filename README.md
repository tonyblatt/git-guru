# git-guru

Utility scripts for automating common git action sets

## Setup

1. Clone Git-guru (git clone https://github.com/tonyblatt/git-guru.git)
2. Execute `setup.sh` in the setup directory

## Scripts

### checkout

Checks out the specified branch. More specifically, the script follows these steps:
1. checkout the primary branch
2. pulls the primary branch
3. checks out the branch (creates the branch if it doesn't already exist.)

(In the future, I should add the ability to specify a different base branch other than the primary branch.)

#### Usage

```shell
checkout branch_name
```

### complete_branches

Deletes all branches specified as parameters. Protects from deleting the repository specified primary branch and other commonly specified primary branch names (develop, main, master). Switches you off the current branch if that branch is specified.

#### Usage

```shell
complete_branches a_branch another_branch a_third_branch
```

### finish_branch_and_new

Checks out the branch as specified by the parameter. Deletes the branch you are currently on. (Same as `checkout <new branch name>` followed by `complete_branches <the branch you started on>`)

#### Usage

```shell
finish_branch_and_new next_branch_to_work_on
```

### push

Pushes the current branch up to the remote repository. If this is the first time the branch has been pushed, open the primary web browser and navigate to the start of the PR process.

```shell
push
```

### gui

Just `git gui`
